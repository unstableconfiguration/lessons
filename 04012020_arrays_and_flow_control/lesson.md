## Arrays and Flow Control
In many tutorials, you start with data types into flow control into arrays, then into 
functions and classes. I wanted to actully push functions first since I consider them 
more complex, and then work backwards for a couple lessons to let them sink in.  

### Arrays  
Arrays are a data type in Javascript and other languages. What they do is hold a collection 
of other values. For example, an array of integers might look like this: 
```
let numberArray = [1, 2, 5, 3];
```
Items in an array are accessed by their 'index', or their position in the array. Arrays in 
.js start at 0, so we can access the first value with the 0 index, the second with the 1 index 
and so on.
```
let one = numberArray[0];
let five = numberArray[3];  
```
