#### Build a mini D&D character object
Pick a D&D character of yours and build an object representing their character sheet. At this point, don't worry about having everything in there, but if you find yourself having fun with it, add in as much as you would like. As a minimum, lets have this: 

* Basic data properties 
    * Name 
    * Race
    * Alignment 
    * Level 
    * Class 
    * Stats
* Functions to calculate data 
    * HP function that returns hit points based on level and con modifier
    * Proficiency function that returns proficiency based on level
    * Stat bonus function that returns the bonus for a given stat based on its numeric value
