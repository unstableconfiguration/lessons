## Assignment: 
Make a page layout for a character sheet.  
* Add a character-sheet.html file to the 'character-sheets' directory I added to this repo. 
* add a character-sheet.css file in the saame directory. 
    * Avoid styling elements in the .html directly except for prototyping. Use your .css file for as much styling as you can in the final draft.  
* The file should be a layout with a distinct section reserved for all the major character sheet components (stats, saves, spells, items, features, details, etc). 
    * Test the layout by resizing the window. Confirm it resizes gracefully for reasonable sizes. We don't need to worry about going down to mobile size for example, but you want to be able to have the window be shrank down to at least a half-screen.

Feel free to take inspiration from one of the thousand different paper-based character sheet layouts, but a lot of those may be fairly advanced for learning css. Don't be worried about doing a more blunt approach. 
If you get to a good place early, feel free to start adding in details, like actually adding in your stats to the area you reserve for stats since that's going to be an obvious next step.
