    <!-- Applying a class
        We just put class="x" to apply it. More than one class can be applied to an element simply 
        by separating the class names with spaces. 

        To apply a css class with javascript we set the 'className' property of the element like: 
        let head = document.getElementById('header1');
        head.className = 'header'; 
    -->
    <div>
        <span id='header1' class='header'>Using a class</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Overriding defaults.</h1>
    </div>

    <!--  
        By default, child elements inherit styles from their parents. 
        In the case of conflicting style rules, the more recent or more local 
        rules are honored. 
    -->
    <div class='inherited'>
        <span>Rules inherited from parent element</span>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span id='by-identifier'>Using ID</span>
    </div>

    <!-- Making compromises. 
        Whenever possible, I prefer visually spacing elements out using line breaks. 
        So for the code below, I would prefer it be 
        <parent>
            <child></child>
            <child></child>
        </parent>
        Where we have a clean visual separation. The problem is, it recognizes the line break 
        as a text element and ends up putting a space between elements that I otherwise want 
        to be flush against one another.  

        With HTML and CSS, it is really hard to maintain purity, and you're going to end up 
        making a lot of compromises. It gets better with experience, and there are ever-better 
        tools to make it easier to work with, but you're still going to have to do the odd 
        ugly hack to get things how you want them.
