<body>
    <!-- Indent whenever you are between tags. 
        It helps you visually keep track of scope. Here, we can easily see everything 
        that is a member of 'body' because it is indented within the <body> tags. 
        
        For my preference, indention is 4 spaces, which is also the default setting for 
        visual studio code. There used to be huge debates about whether to indent using tabs 
        or spaces, but VS code just replaces the tab with 4 spaces so it isn't an issue. Some 
        people prefer 2 space indention to save horizontal space, but I prefer 4 to make the
        indention more apparent.
