        Input elements have several different 'type' options (look up some of
        the others). Here is a button-type input element. It should contain 
        the text 'starting value'. The 'id' is a name we give it to be able to 
        look it up with javascript.

<!-- Referencing scripts: 
    For helloworld.html, we put our javascript inside the .html document. Best practice 
    is to put scripts into their own separate files. The 'src' attribute can find and load 
    the script by file path or URL.
    If we have buttons.js in the same folder as buttons.html, then buttons.js should load when 
    we open buttons.html in a browser.
