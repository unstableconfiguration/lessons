Egh, so that's 3 lessons, none of which really has a distinct assignment that can be associated with them. For now, lets do some easy busy work. 

#### Create a character-sheet.html file 
Create a character-sheet html file. And start adding controls to it. For now, don't worry about layout or style, we'll use it to start covering CSS later. Have one control for each data point in your yorim character sheet; more can be added if you want to. 

Go ahead and bind yorim's data to the html elements so they each display a value. We'll be re-architecting this in the future, but for now we just want to lay the groundwork.
