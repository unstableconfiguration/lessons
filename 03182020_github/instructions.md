## 03-18-2020: Using github
I was going to wait a bit before introducing new tools, but since email is proving clunky for sending 
files back and forth, lets have this lesson be about using source control. Some of this stuff takes a 
bit to sink in, so we're going to stick to the basics and let it become more familiar over time. 

### Source Control / Version Control 
Source control is vital to development, especially as a professional. Source control provides us with 
a place to store our code, and tools to sync up with it so that we don't end up with very different 
versions of it on each of our computers. It also proves safety against local failures so that we aren't
one crash away from losing everything.

We'll be using [Github](https://www.github.com) for our source control since it is free and heavily 
used. Specifically we'll use my github account [unstableconfiguration](https://www.github.com/unstableconfiguration), which I'm adding a 'lessons' repository to. 

We'll interact with it using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for now since it is 
easy to set up and use.  

#### Setup: 
* Download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)  
* Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com)
* Open github desktop and select 'clone a repository from the internet'
    * For the URL: https://github.com/unstableconfiguration/lessons.git
    * For the Local Path: c:\users\{username}\source\lessons
At this point, it should go ahead and download everything from there to your HD. 

#### Making Changes:
